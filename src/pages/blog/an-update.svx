Hi everyone. It's wolfr here. I am helping with Routify's community.

It's been about two weeks since we released the 1.5 version of Routify. You can read all about that in our previous blog post [here](https://routify.dev/blog/announcing-1.5).

Our release was met with a positive reception. We've had lots of people make the jump and give Routify a try, as evidenced by Github's dependency graph which shows over 100 repos using Routify now.

We've also gotten some excellent bug reports, with pull requests and ideas coming in. Open source as it should be! In this post I would like to summarize what happened. Here's some highlights:

* The latest version of Routify is **1.6.4**. You can check out all the releases [here](https://github.com/sveltech/routify/releases).
  * Overall, several bugs have been fixed
  * The 1.6 release added a new feature: an `afterPageLoad` hook.
* LegionOfOne created a [Routify starter that works with Firebase](https://github.com/lpshanley/routify-starter-firebase)
* We added a new [generated navigation](https://routify.dev/examples/generated-navigation) example. I also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j0zYxsZ-7I) that explains how to work with the generated navigation.
* Jakob did a presentation at [Svelte Society Day](https://sveltesociety.dev/) around Routify and its feature set. You can watch the presentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RXqJGZUxy4).
* Documentation on the site has been updated with [Starter Template](/guide/starter-Template) and [Navigation](/guide/navigation) both being added to the guide.

There's also some questions. The biggest question we get is how Routify compares to Sapper. The answer is a bit complicated, in the sense that it's still being defined. On our Discord channel, we have been talking about a new project named **Roxi**. If you'd like to jump in on the conversation, make sure to check the #roxi channel.
